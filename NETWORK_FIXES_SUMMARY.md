# Network Connection Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

The InvestorDashboard was experiencing repeated network errors with the MASchain service:
- `net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES`
- `Failed to fetch` errors
- Continuous retry loops causing API rate limiting

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Smart Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
- Added intelligent retry mechanism with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Limited retries to prevent infinite loops (max 2 retries)
- Only retry on specific network errors (Failed to fetch, ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES)

### 2. Request Throttling and Rate Limiting
- Implemented request throttling in MASchain service (minimum 1 second between requests)
- Added request queue to serialize API calls
- Prevents overwhelming the MASchain testnet API

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
- Added circuit breaker to prevent continuous failed requests
- After 3 consecutive failures, service enters "circuit breaker" mode for 30 seconds
- Automatically resets after timeout period

### 4. Debounced Connection Handling
- Added debouncing to wallet connection changes (500ms delay)
- Prevents rapid successive API calls when wallet state changes
- Uses React useCallback for optimized performance

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling and User Feedback
- Added service status tracking (`available`, `degraded`, `unavailable`)
- User-friendly status indicators in the UI
- Graceful fallback to mock data when service is unavailable
- Retry button for users when service is degraded

### 6. Improved Loading States
- Better loading state management during retries
- Clear loading indicators that don't get stuck
- Proper cleanup of loading states after failures

## Contract Address Configuration

‚úÖ **All contract addresses are properly configured:**
- **GreenPOSNetworkEnhanced**: `0xd7751A299eb97C8e9aF8f378b0c9138851a267b9`
- **GPS Token**: `0xe979a16123F028EAcE7F33b4191E872b5E3695C0`
- All addresses loaded from environment variables (no hardcoded values)
- SmartContractDemo component updated to use config-based addresses

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/InvestorDashboard.tsx`
   - Enhanced retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Added service status tracking and UI indicators
   - Implemented debounced connection handling
   - Added user-friendly retry functionality

2. `src/services/maschain.ts`
   - Added request throttling and queue management
   - Implemented circuit breaker pattern
   - Enhanced error tracking and recovery

3. `src/components/SmartContractDemo.tsx`
   - Updated to use config-based contract addresses
   - Removed hardcoded contract address

4. `.env` and `.env.example`
   - Updated with correct deployed contract address
   - All configuration properly aligned

## Expected Behavior

üîÑ **Normal Operation:**
- Connects to MASchain service successfully
- Displays real-time contract data
- Green status indicator (service available)

‚ö†Ô∏è  **Degraded Service:**
- Falls back to demo data when network issues occur
- Yellow status indicator with retry option
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff

üö´ **Service Unavailable:**
- Circuit breaker active after multiple failures
- Red status indicator
- Waits 30 seconds before allowing retry attempts

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users see clear status and can understand when demo data is being used
2. **Reduced API Load**: Prevents hammering the MASchain API with failed requests
3. **Resilient Architecture**: System continues to function even with network issues
4. **Developer Friendly**: Clear error messages and status indicators for debugging
5. **Production Ready**: Proper error handling and recovery mechanisms

The system now handles network issues gracefully while maintaining full functionality through intelligent fallbacks and user-friendly error states.
