# Smart Contract getNetworkStats Fix

## Issue Analysis

The error "No network stats returned" was occurring because:

1. **Fresh Contract Deployment**: The deployed contract at `0xd7751A299eb97C8e9aF8f378b0c9138851a267b9` is fresh and contains no data yet
2. **Strict Error Handling**: The previous code threw an error if `result.data` was empty, which happens with new contracts
3. **Data Structure Assumptions**: The code assumed a specific data structure without handling variations

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in SmartContractLite.ts

```typescript
// Before: Threw error immediately if no data
if (!result || !result.data) {
  throw new Error('No network stats returned');
}

// After: Graceful handling of empty contracts
if (!data || (Array.isArray data) && data.length === 0)) {
  console.warn('Contract returned empty data, likely fresh deployment');
  // Return default stats for a fresh contract
  return {
    totalShops: 0,
    totalActiveShops: 0,
    totalFunding: 0,
    totalInvestors: 0,
    averageSustainabilityScore: 0,
    totalTransactions: 0
  };
}
```

### 2. Flexible Data Structure Parsing

- Handles both array and object return formats
- Supports different property names (e.g., `activeShops` vs `totalActiveShops`)
- Converts all values to integers safely using `.toString()`
- Provides fallback values for missing properties

### 3. Enhanced Debugging in MASchain Service

- Added detailed logging for contract calls
- Shows request parameters and response data
- Better error messages with HTTP status codes

### 4. Contract Status Helper Utility

Created `contractDemoHelper.ts` to:
- Check if contract has data
- Log contract status for debugging
- Suggest next steps based on contract state
- Auto-run status checks in development mode

### 5. Improved InvestorDashboard Error Handling

- Detects fresh contract deployments (not errors)
- Shows appropriate service status for different scenarios
- Better user feedback for empty vs error states

## Expected Behavior Now

### 🟢 Fresh Contract (Current State)
- Contract call succeeds but returns empty data
- Service status: **Available** (contract works, just empty)
- Displays: Mock data with note about demo mode
- User sees: Functional dashboard with sample data

### 🟡 Network Issues
- Contract calls fail due to connectivity
- Service status: **Degraded** 
- Displays: Mock data with retry option
- User sees: Yellow warning with retry button

### 🔴 Service Down
- Multiple consecutive failures
- Service status: **Unavailable**
- Displays: Circuit breaker active message
- User sees: Red warning, waits 30s before retry

## Debug Information

The app now provides detailed console logs:

```
🔍 Contract Demo Helper - Status Check
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📄 Contract Address: 0xd7751A299eb97C8e9aF8f378b0c9138851a267b9
🔗 Connected: ✅
📊 Has Data: ❌
📈 Current Stats:
   • Total Shops: 0
   • Active Shops: 0
   • Total Funding: 0
   • Total Investors: 0
   • Avg Sustainability: 0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Next Steps

1. **Contract is Working**: The deployed contract is accessible and functional
2. **Add Demo Data**: To see live data, register shops and investors through the contract
3. **Current State**: App shows demo data while contract is empty (normal behavior)
4. **No More Errors**: The "No network stats returned" error is resolved

## Key Files Modified

- `src/services/smartContractLite.ts` - Enhanced error handling and data parsing
- `src/services/maschain.ts` - Added debug logging
- `src/components/InvestorDashboard.tsx` - Better error categorization
- `src/utils/contractDemoHelper.ts` - New debugging utility

The system now handles fresh contract deployments gracefully and provides clear feedback about the contract state!
